# Smart Townhouse Project
Welcome to the Smart Townhouse project! This project aims to create an intelligent system for monitoring and controlling various aspects of a townhouse, including home and garage functionalities. The system utilizes ESP microcontrollers connected to sensors, providing real-time data and control through a Kotlin mobile app.

Features
Home Module
Earthquake Detection:

Utilizes MPU6050 gyroscope to detect and measure seismic activity.
Notifies users in case of an earthquake through the mobile app.
Gas Leak Monitoring:

Integrates MQ-4 gas detector to measure methane/natural gas concentration.
Sends real-time gas level data to the mobile app for monitoring.
Temperature and Humidity Sensing:

Uses DHT11 sensor to measure ambient temperature and humidity.
Displays data on an LCD screen and updates the mobile app.
Flame Detection:

Incorporates a flame sensor to detect fire incidents.
Triggers water pump to extinguish fire and sends alerts to the mobile app.
LCD Display:

Shows real-time sensor data on a character LCD display.
Garage Module
Password-Protected Access:

Features a membrane keypad for secure access to the garage.
Allows users to input a password to open the garage door.
Fire Safety:

Includes a flame sensor to detect fire incidents in the garage.
Water Pump Control:

Activates a water pump to extinguish fire in the garage.
